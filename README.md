# Fake-News-Detection Using Machine Learning- An NLP Approach
This project implements fake news detection using machine learning and deep learning models. The dataset used is the ISOT Fake News Dataset, which contains labeled news articles categorized as "True" (0) or "Fake" (1). The goal is to accurately classify news articles and evaluate model performance using standard metrics.
## Dataset
The ISOT Fake News Dataset, curated by Dr. Ahmed H. Ahmed at the University of Victoria, consists of two types of news articles:

* True News: Obtained from Reuters.
* Fake News: Collected from various unreliable sources flagged by fact-checking organizations.
You can learn more about the dataset from here: https://www.impactcybertrust.org/dataset_view?idDataset=952 

The dataset contains:

* Class 0 (True News): Reliable and fact-checked articles.
* Class 1 (Fake News): Articles flagged as unreliable or misleading.
## Features
* Data Preprocessing such as cleaning, tokenization, and preparation of the dataset.
* Model Implementation:
  1. Logistic Regression (LR)
  2. Random Forest (RF)
  3. Naive Bayes (NB)
  4. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network
* Performance Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score are used to evaluate each model.
## Results
The table below summarizes the performance of the models:
