Detecting Fake News: A Machine Learning Approach Using the ISOT Dataset
#Summary
This project aims to explore and analyze the significant textual features that distinguish fake news from legitimate news articles using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. With the rapid spread of misinformation on social media, identifying and mitigating fake news is crucial. The ISOT dataset, provided by the University of Victoria, will be utilized to train and evaluate various machine learning models to determine their effectiveness in fake news detection.
# About Dataset
ISOT Fake News Dataset
The dataset contains two types of articles fake and real News. This dataset was collected from realworld sources; the truthful articles were obtained by crawling articles from Reuters.com (News
website). As for the fake news articles, they were collected from different sources. The fake news
articles were collected from unreliable websites that were flagged by Politifact (a fact-checking
organization in the USA) and Wikipedia. The dataset contains different types of articles on different
topics, however, the majority of articles focus on political and World news topics.
The dataset consists of two CSV files. The first file named “True.csv” contains more than 12,600
articles from reuter.com. The second file named “Fake.csv” contains more than 12,600 articles from
different fake news outlet resources. Each article contains the following information: article title, text,
type and the date the article was published on. To match the fake news data collected for kaggle.com,
we focused mostly on collecting articles from 2016 to 2017. The data collected were cleaned and
processed, however, the punctuations and mistakes that existed in the fake news were kept in the text.
# Purpose of the Dataset
This dataset is intended for research and development purposes, specifically for projects focused on detecting fake news through machine learning and natural language processing techniques. It provides a rich resource for analyzing textual features and developing effective classification models.
